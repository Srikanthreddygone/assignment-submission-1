    <P>The Parsis were the first Indian civilian community to take to cricket. They set up the Oriental Cricket Club in Mumbai in 1848. It did a premature death, but the community then established the Young Zoroastrians Club in 1850. They were followed by the Hindus, who formed the Hindu Gymkhana in 1866. The scene of the cricketing activities of the Mumbai locals was the Esplanade 'maidan,' which was situated in front of the western ramparts of the erstwhile Bombay 'Fort' (demolished in 1860). At the far end of this 'maidan' was a plot of land that was out of bounds for dogs and Indians - the Bombay Gymkhana.</P>

<p>After helping India beat England in all three formats of the game, skipper Virat Kohli and his deputy Rohit Sharma will resume their rivalry on April 9 in the lung opener of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2021. It will be another chapter in their famed rivalry, which many believed has extra spice due to some rift. (More Cricket News)

    It's worth noting that, after India's ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 semi-final defeat to New Zealand, reports emerged that there is a rift between the two leaders. Reacting to the reported fall-out, legendary Sunil Gavaskar haad even said that "Virat and Rohit can shout from the rooftops as much as they can but this story won't end."
